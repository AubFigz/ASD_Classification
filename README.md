Integrative Gene Expression Analysis for Autism Biomarker Identification and Classification Using Machine Learning

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, and behavior. This study aims to identify genetic biomarkers for ASD by analyzing gene expression data and developing predictive models for classifying ASD and control samples. Using dataset GDS4431 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, differential expression analysis was conducted with t-tests and adjusted p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The identified significant DEGs were refined using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with various classifiers to determine the optimal features for the models, enhancing their predictive accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna optimized model performance, and all individual models and model combinations were evaluated using stratified k-fold cross-validation, with ROC-AUC as the primary metric. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values provided insights into feature importance for models. This integrative approach identified key genetic markers and developed robust models for ASD classification, offering a foundation for future research and potential clinical applications.
